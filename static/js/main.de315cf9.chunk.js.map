As you play further into the game,\n        a few more mechanics are introduced.\n      </Body>\n      <Body>\n        There are a total of 30 levels in the game you can work through.\n      </Body>\n      <SubTitle>Design Goals</SubTitle>\n      <Body>\n        I spent a lot of this project's lifespan working out <i>'game feel'</i>{\" \"}\n        as well as trying to teach the player as much as possible about game\n        mechanics through level design, rather than text.\n      </Body>\n      <Body>\n        I'm super happy how the feeling of playing the game came out— I think it\n        was one of my biggest accomplishments in this project and made for a\n        huge stepping stone for me as a game developer & designer. On this\n        topic, I was fortunate enough to get some great feedback in a twitter\n        conversation I had with{\" \"}\n        <InlineLink href=\"https://twitter.com/KennyYSun\" type=\"external\">\n          Kenny Sun\n        </InlineLink>\n        , one of my favorite game developers at the time.\n      </Body>\n      <Body>\n        Really my biggest take away from that conversation was Kenny pointing me\n        to{\" \"}\n        <InlineLink\n          href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg&ab_channel=grapefrukt\"\n          type=\"external\"\n        >\n          this video about adding juice to your game\n        </InlineLink>\n        . After watching that, it was all about adding impact with each move you\n        make as the player. I used sound effects, subtle graphics, and added\n        physics to the board to pull this off.\n      </Body>\n      <Image src={soma2} />\n      <Body>\n        Adding physics to the board ended up being a super cool effect that\n        brought the puzzle to life. I ran with this idea and added all of those\n        little emotions you see shoot out of the board as you play. This weird,\n        slightly anxiety inducing effect, combined with the calming background\n        music made for a bizarre aesthetic that I liked a lot.\n      </Body>\n      <Body>\n        What I had a lot more trouble with was teaching through level design. I\n        think the best way I could have solved this problem would be if I had a\n        lot more test players to observe, followed by constant fine tuning. But\n        from the test players I did have, most of the 'hints' I left would go\n        unnoticed. And then people would struggle with levels I thought the\n        solutions to would be obvious.\n      </Body>\n      <SubTitle>Flaws</SubTitle>\n      <Body>\n        One of the biggest flaws of this game is the difficulty curve, like I\n        just mentioned before. Levels that were meant to be easy would take much\n        longer to solve than intended, and many times would turn into tedious\n        trial & error rather than actual problem solving.\n      </Body>\n      <Body>\n        Besides that, there are just some relatively minor design flaws I see—\n        the biggest one for me being the counter for <i>turns left</i>.

When we look at MegaPortraits, the paper which VASA-1 bases\n        its motion encoder off of, we see that the motion encoding is a heavily\n        compressed set of features extracted from each frame. VASA-1's audio\n        driver then does next-token prediction <b>in the motion latent space</b>\n        .\n      </Body>\n      <Body>\n        My model's motion encoder, V-JEPA, only slightly compresses each frame—\n        a lot of visual information ends up encoded into the motion features.\n        Our audio driver also predicts directly into latent pixel space, not\n        motion space. There are three main problems here. Our motion\n        conditioning includes the motion encoding for frame <i>t-1</i>, which is\n        very similar to frame <i>t</i>, the target frame for the model to\n        predict. Since these V-JEPA encodings hold a lot of visual information,\n        the model may be incentivized to simply copy the visual information\n        found in the <i>t-1</i> motion encoding instead of learning meaningful\n        relationships between the reference photo, past motion, and audio. The\n        second problem is that any visual artifacts found in our model's frame\n        predictions leak into the motion encodings when we predict the next\n        frame, which then end up feeding further into the first problem, leading\n        to compounding errors/instability during inference.\n      </Body>\n      <Body>\n        Lastly, V-JEPA is slightly too inefficient for real-time inference,\n        which is a key requirement for this project. The design of our model is\n        more aligned with EMO, which is able to achieve stability using a U-NET\n        architecture as well as several auxillary networks. But EMO is far off\n        from real-time inference. After assessing these problems, I took a\n        closer look at VASA-1 and MegaPortraits to see what aspects I could\n        adopt both for efficiency and inference stability with the time I had\n        left.\n      </Body>\n      <SubTitle>Model (Re)development</SubTitle>\n      <Body>\n        Before diving into re-architecting the model, I focused on building a\n        steady pipeline for the improved dataset I outlined in the previous\n        dataset section, to ensure I had something valuable to deliver upon\n        completing the contract. After this, with about two weeks remaining, my\n        focus turned toward MegaPortraits.\n      </Body>\n      <Image\n        src={megaportraits_diagram}\n        displayType=\"regular\"\n        caption=\"Diagram from MegaPortraits paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07621)\"\n      />\n      <Body>\n        The methods from MegaPortraits cover training both the motion and\n        identity encoders. The two encoders and their combined \"decoder\" are\n        trained together in a semi-supervised fashion. For training, the basic\n        idea is to take two random frames from the same video, one as the{\" \"}\n        <i>reference frame</i>, the other as the <i>motion frame</i>. We encode\n        the reference identity and motion with their respective encoders. We\n        pass both of these encodings through a network that generates a set of\n        transformations. These transformations are then applied to the identity\n        encodings, yielding an output of the given identity, contorted into the\n        shape/position of the given motion. During training, since both frames\n        come from the same video, we re-use the motion frame as the prediction\n        target.\n      </Body>\n      <Body>\n        The key is to <i>disentangle</i> the identity and motion (i.e. ensure no\n        visual information leaks into the motion encodings). MegaPortraits\n        achieves this disentanglement with a meticulously designed architecture\n        and extensive set of loss functions to guide the model. If this is done\n        successfully, during inference we should be able to control a reference\n        photo with a set of motion frames, even if the identity in the motion\n        frames differ from the reference, like shown in the diagram above.\n      </Body>\n      <Body>\n        I put together my own implementation of this model. Frankly, I was\n        cutting several corners at this point due to time constraints, knowing\n        that each training run was going to take quite some time. In\n        MegaPortraits there are feature matching losses used in conjunction with\n        several pre-trained vision models to encode strong learning signals into\n        the gradients. I did not prioritize these and I believe that was a\n        mistake. I think these were essential and would contribute to faster\n        convergence, allowing for more training attempts. The loss functions I\n        used were:\n      </Body>\n      <BulletList\n        content={[\n          <BulletBody>\n            <b>Reconstruction loss</b> between the model output and target frame\n          </BulletBody>,\n          <BulletBody>\n            <b>GAN hinge loss</b>, with the discriminator trained to distinguish\n            between the model output and target frame\n          </BulletBody>,\n          <BulletBody>\n            <b>Feature matching loss</b> between the intermediate layer features\n            of the discriminator on the model output and target frame\n          </BulletBody>,\n          <BulletBody>\n            Positive deep <b>cosine similarity loss</b> between the reference\n            encodings of the identity and motion frames\n          </BulletBody>,\n          <BulletBody>\n            Negative deep <b>cosine similarity loss</b> between the identity\n            encodings of the reference frame and an alternate identity\n          </BulletBody>,\n        ]}\n      />\n      <Body>\n        Something was off, which I was unable to resolve it in the bit of time\n        remaining. The training outputs I was getting were noisy, and it seemed\n        that it was combining the background from the reference frame with the\n        identity of the motion frame. There are a number of things that may have\n        been cause for issue. Many of my hyperparameter selections were\n        arbitrary at best. There was a lot of noise in some of the samples (ex:\n        see the highly complex background in the sample with Ashton Kutcher\n        above, with a crowd of people making motion in the background). And as\n        mentioned earlier, I did not have the loss functions on pre-trained\n        vision model features that MegaPortraits had.\n      </Body>\n\n      <SubTitle>Looking Back, Looking Forward</SubTitle>\n      <Body>\n        The contract was coming to a close. Around the same time someone else\n        was joining on, looking to get deeper into AI research. I wanted a new\n        environment— somewhere with the resources available to properly support\n        me and the work I would be a part of. Further, I want to be part of\n        something bigger than me, and I want to work with others with more\n        experience than myself, who I can look up to and learn from. I am\n        thankful for OCAI LTD for taking a risk on me, and for giving me the\n        opportunity to freely explore this topic. I took some time in the days\n        following the contract to meet with the new person to catch them up to\n        speed with the repository, the dataset, and my thoughts for next steps.\n      </Body>\n      <Body>\n        If I were to continue working on this task, I would spend time further\n        refining the dataset. I would be interested in passing samples through a\n        pre-trained segmentation model focused on portraits to remove the\n        background to give the model a cleaner signal to train on, working with\n        in-painting methods later in the process to fill the background. I would\n        also want to introduce more identities by bringing in the{\" \"}\n        <InlineLink\n          type=\"external\"\n          href=\"https://github.com/tcwang0509/TalkingHead-1KH\"\n        >\n          TalkingHead-1KH\n        </InlineLink>{\" \"}\n        and{\" \"}\n        <InlineLink\n          type=\"external\"\n          href=\"https://github.com/deepbrainai-research/koeba\"\n        >\n          Koeba\n        </InlineLink>{\" \"}\n        datasets. I would then move on to perfecting the MegaPortraits motion\n        controller system— ensuring I was using all of the right loss functions,\n        and bring in the necessary pre-trained models both for guidance and as\n        backbones. Finally after this, I could focus on driving with audio\n        through a DiT like in VASA-1, working in the robust motion latent space\n        of the MegaPortraits model.\n      </Body>\n      <Body>\n        Sometimes when I'm building AI, I think, \"That's it, That worked?\"{\" \"}\n        <i>and marvel at how easy it can be</i>.

It's\n        a feeling familiar to when I first started programming a long time ago,\n        shifting focus between the simplicity of the core principles and the\n        particularity the compiler insists on when I want to do something so\n        simple.\n      </Body>\n      <Body>\n        There were many humbling moments this past couple of months.
