We encode the reference identity and motion with their respective encoders. We pass both of these encodings through a network that generates a set of transformations. These transformations are then applied to the identity encodings, yielding an output of the given identity, contorted into the shape/position of the given motion.

There was a lot of noise in some of the samples (ex: see the highly complex background in the sample with Ashton Kutcher above, with a crowd of people making motion in the background).
