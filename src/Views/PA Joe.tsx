        <i>MBMS</i> is a company in Buffalo that I interned at as a software
        developer. It was pretty standard workâ€” fixing bugs and creating front
        end features for a web app was most of what I did.

        I learned a lot on the job, as this was my first experience writing code
        in a professional environment. It was my first time interacting with a
        massive code base, working with a SCRUM board, seeing the importance of
        QA, testing suites, and a bunch more. And then trying to decipher 15
        year old pieces of code written by somebody who left the company like 7
        years ago was, uh... just another great learning experience!

        Jokes aside, even though I decided to leave the company to pursue my own
        personal goals, it was a great experience I'll always be super thankful
        for having. My only real plight was that we used{" "}
        <InlineLink
          type="external"
          href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/tfvc/what-is-tfvc?view=azure-devops"
        >
          TFVC
        </InlineLink>
        , rather than{" "}
        <InlineLink type="external" href="https://git-scm.com/">
          git
        </InlineLink>
        , which I did not love. I know that when I was there though we were
        actively working to migrate to use git.
