        , Marie, & myself. It's loosely meant to be a conspiracy theory podcast,

        We started off recording on the Wellington radio when we were studying
        abroad in New Zealand. After leaving New Zealand we started recording
        over Skype, releasing an episode about once per month. Going from a
        radio station to Skype has been a bit of a downgrade but it's still been
        a great experience!
